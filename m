The Board of Directors election and the vote on the By-laws concluded at
14:00 UTC on May 1st 2023 and these are the results:

- We had 75 members this year, of which 55 cast a vote, so the turnout
is 73.3%.

- On the question "Do you accept the proposed By-Law changes to make SFC
the new fiscal sponsor of the X.Org foundation, replacing SPI?" 52 of
the 55 members voted yes (94.5%). Among all 75 members, approval is
69.3% (52/75, over 2/3), so we can consider this change approved using
the current by-law rules.

- On the question "Do you accept the proposed By-Law changes to modify
the special voting quorum requirements to be limited to present (meaning
voting) members?" 48 of the 55 members voted yes (87.3%). Despite this,
48 votes represent only 64% of the members, which means the by-laws
change does not pass.

- In the election of the Directors to the Board of the X.Org Foundation,
the results were that Daniel Vetter, Lyude Paul, Arkadiusz Hiler and
Christopher Michael were elected for two-year terms.

The old full board is: Emma Anholt, Mark Filion, Ricardo Garcia, Samuel
Iglesias Gons=C3=A1lvez, Manasi D Navare, Lyude Paul, Alyssa Rosenzweig and
Daniel Vetter.

The new full board is: Emma Anholt, Mark Filion, Ricardo Garcia,
Arkadiusz Hiler, Christopher Michael, Lyude Paul, Alyssa Rosenzweig and
Daniel Vetter.

Full election results, sorted by points:

* Daniel Vetter (367 points)
* Lyude Paul (348 points)
* Arkadiusz Hiler (286 points)
* Christopher Michael (263 points)
* Manasi Navare (195 points)
* Uma Shankar (157 points)
* Thomas Adam (105 points)
* William Weeks-Balconi (51 points)

Thanks everyone,
-Ricardo Garcia, on behalf of the X.Org elections committee
