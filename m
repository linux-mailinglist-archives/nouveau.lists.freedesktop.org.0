Hi Ben,

Long time no talk! I just wanted to express my deepest thanks for 
everything you have done, against all odds!

You are right that now is the perfect time for the relieving of the 
guard, as Nouveau is entering a new era and is about to look very 
different. Thanks for getting us there!

Enjoy your well-deserved change of scenery, and I wish you luck wherever 
life will bring you next! Hopefully, we'll get to meet once more!

Cheers,
Martin
