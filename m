No, there are two paths in the _OFF() and them some common code such as
removing power etc.

What the _REV 5 did is that it went into path where the AML seemed to
directly disable the link.

The other path that is taken with Windows 8+ does not disable the link
but instead it puts it to low power L2 or L3 state (I suppose L3 since
it removes the power and the GPU probably does not support wake).

The ASL code is below. PGOF() gets called from the power resource
_OFF():

According to this:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/pci/pci-power-management-and-device-drivers#scenario-1-turning-off-a-device

it does write PMCSR.

Yes, I think that is better approach.
