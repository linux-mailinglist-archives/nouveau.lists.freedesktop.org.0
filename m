Reviving this thread as we have another user (rightfully) complaining on 
IRC about this.

The way I see it there's two issues:
1) snd_hda_intel not allowing runpm (or w/e vgaswitcheroo needs) when 
there's missing codecs, inhibiting the entire GPU from performing runpm. 
This needlessly wastes lots of battery power.
2) HDMI audio not working on such machines unless it was plugged in at 
boot-time.

The original workarounds proposed by Kai-Heng seem to fix 1), which is 
progress. I don't see a reason why that should be held off even if it 
doesn't fix 2).
To fix 2), more work is needed. On a high level, I suspect nouveau 
should start controlling the enabling/disabling of the HDA controller 
based on connector events and/or connector state at module load. 
Currently the PCI quirk seems to enable it wholesale, and I don't know 
why. If no GPU driver is loaded, it's pointless to turn the HDA device 
on. The blob presumably doesn't need this either, as it can control the 
device just as well as nouveau. If it doesn't, NVIDIA should fix it 
rather than rely on this quirk. The only reason I can think of is that 
snd_hda_intel or vgaswitcheroo isn't prepared for hot(un)plugging (or 
alternatively reprobing) devices. Without that, we presumably won't 
solve issue 2). Can I ask someone with more technical knowledge of 
snd_hda_intel and vgaswitcheroo to brainstorm about the possible 
challenges of nouveau taking matters into its own hand rather than 
keeping this PCI quirk around?
