No problem.  I also didn't really express clearly last time, I'm happy we can
discuss this more thoroughly, even if it may be a corner case only.

Yes, I think calling that unconditionally should be enough.

Aha, I totally missed this when I read last time (of follow_trans_huge_pmd)..

	page += (addr & ~HPAGE_PMD_MASK) >> PAGE_SHIFT;

Now I agree it'll always return subpage, even if thp mapped.  And do
FOLL_SPLIT_PMD makes sense too to do early break on cow pages as you said
before.

I feel like it's illegal to access page->mapping of tail pages; I looked at
what happens if we call page_anon_vma() on a tail page:

struct anon_vma *page_anon_vma(struct page *page)
{
	unsigned long mapping;

	page = compound_head(page);
	mapping = (unsigned long)page->mapping;
	if ((mapping & PAGE_MAPPING_FLAGS) != PAGE_MAPPING_ANON)
		return NULL;
	return __page_rmapping(page);
}

It'll just take the head's mapping instead.  It makes sense since the tail page
shouldn't have a different value against the head page, afaiu.

It would be great if thp experts could chim in.  Before that happens, I agree
with you that a safer approach is to explicitly not walk a tail page for its
rmap (and I think the rmap of a tail page will be the same of the head
anyways.. since they seem to share the anon_vma as quoted).

Agreed.

Could I ask why?  split_huge_pmd_address() will notify with CLEAR, so I'm a bit
confused why we need to pass over the owner.

I thought plumb it right before your EXCLUSIVE notifier init would work?
