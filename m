I don't have anything against this patch, as long as the quirk stays
limited to the particular root port leading to the NVIDIA GPU. The
reason why I think it should to be limited is that I'm pretty certain
the problem is not in the root port itself. I have here a KBL based
Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th gen that can put the TBT controller into D3cold
(it is connected to PCH root port) and it wakes up there just fine, so
don't want to break that.

Now, PCIe devices cannot go into D3cold all by themselves. They always
need help from the platform side which is ACPI in this case. This is
done by having the device to have _PR3 method that returns one or more
power resources that the OS is supposed to turn off when the device is
put into D3cold. All of that is implemented as form of ACPI methods that
pretty much do the hardware specific things that are outside of PCIe
spec to get the device into D3cold. At high level the _OFF() method
causes the root port to broadcast PME_Turn_Off message that results the
link to enter L2/3 ready, it then asserts PERST, configures WAKE (both
can be GPIOs) and finally removes power (if the link goes into L3,
otherwise it goes into L2).

I think this is where the problem actually lies - the ASL methods that
are used to put the device into D3cold and back. We know that in Windows
this all works fine so unless Windows quirks the root port the same way
there is another reason behind this.

In case of Dell XPS 9560 (IIRC that's the machine you have) the
corresponding power resource is called \_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PG00 and its
_ON/_OFF methods end up calling PGON()/PGOF() accordingly. The methods
itself do lots of things and it is hard to follow the dissassembled
ASL which does not have any comments but there are couple of things that
stand out where we may go into a different path. One of them is this in
the PGOF() method:

   If (((OSYS <= 0x07D9) || ((OSYS == 0x07DF) && (_REV == 0x05))))

The ((OSYS == 0x07DF) && (_REV == 0x05)) checks specifically for Linux
(see [1] and 18d78b64fddc ("ACPI / init: Make it possible to override
_REV")) so it might be that Dell people tested this at some point in
Linux as well. Added Mario in case he has any ideas.

Previously I suggested you to try the ACPI method tracing to see what
happens inside PGOF(). Did you have time to try it? It may provide more
information about that is happening inside those methods and hopefully
point us to the root cause.

Also if you haven't tried already passing acpi_rev_override in the
command line makes the _REV to return 5 so it should go into the "Linux"
path in PGOF().
