As I already mentioned in my previous email, the vendor drivers have
been using something like:

	if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() != acpi_backlight_vendor)
		return;

In their backlight register paths *since 2015* and even before
then most of them called some acpi_video helper function to determine
if ACPI video backlight control was available and skipped registering
their backlight device if that returned true. And calling that
acpi_video helper is as smart as they traditionally were. That +
DMI quirks and we still have all those quirks.

I was very careful with the refactoring landing in 6.1 to *not*
change any of this.

The *only* behavior which actually is new in 6.1 is the native GPU
drivers now doing the equivalent of:

	if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() != acpi_backlight_native)
		return;

In their backlight register paths (i), which is causing the native
backlight to disappear on your custom laptop setup and on Chromebooks
(with the Chromebooks case being already solved I hope.).

I am fully aware that this may turn out to also impact other laptops.
I'm keeping out an eye for this and I have specifically reached-out
to the coreboot community asking them to test 6.1 .

Yes I am considering dropping the "acpi_video_get_backlight_type() !=
acpi_backlight_native" check from at least the i915 driver if we get more
bug reports and then indeed only do the equivalent of that check in
the code for the new output property.

I agree this is a possible solution if this turns out to break more
systems and there is no other easy/clean way to fix those. But I would
greatly prefer to keep this change and stop the IMHO bad kernel behavior
of "registering multiple backlight-devices for a single panel and then
let userspace sort it out".

Regards,

Hans


i) Before this, the kernel was relying on userspace preferring acpi_video
or vendor backlight devices over native if both are present and the
native backlight devices were registered unconditionally.
