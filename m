It does not necessary lead to lock-up. Here is dmesg from Karol's
system:

  https://gist.githubusercontent.com/karolherbst/40eb091c7b7b33ef993525de660f1a3b/raw/2380e31f566e93e5ba7c87ef545420965d4c492c/gistfile1.txt

what seems to happen is that the GPU never "comes back" from D3cold so
the driver starts breaking apart as the hardware is gone now.

You mean in this particular case or in general? Because if the port has
_PSx methods we need to put it into D3hot AFAIK.

My understanding (which may not be correct) is that up to Windows 7 it
never put the devices into D3cold runtime. Only when the system entered
Sx states it evaluated the _OFF methods.

Starting from Windows 8 it started doing this runtime so devices can
enter D3cold even when system is in S0.

I guess it depends on how you interpret the specs ;-) From PCIe 5.0 sec
5.8 we can see the supported PM state transitions and it shows that you
get to D3cold through D3hot. Of course the device goes into D3cold if
you simply remove its power so I agree with you as well. However, if
there is _PS3 method we can't skip the D3hot phase.
